MCA-112:DS LAB Practical
1. Using the insertion sort method,write a program to sort elements 12,56,3,7,9,35,11,19,25 and 75.
2. write a program to display a hash table after inserting elements 18,21,26,36,33,46,26 and 144 into a hash table of size 10,using double hashing,where h(x)=x mod 10, h2(x)=x mod 6 +1.
3. Assume a real world problem and write its solution by using at least 02 DS(stack,queue,linklist) concpts while implementing the required solution.
